* for REUSE_SOCKET redirect should update conn->host

PERSISTENT CONNECTIONS

This didn't help as much as I hoped. Only 12 of the 38 comics I tested
have the image on the same site as the page. It doesn't help that
gocomics (23/38) redirects :(

However, it is pretty easy to implement and doesn't really cost
anything so let's leave it on for the non-curl case.

INDEX FILES

Ignoring Poorly Drawn Lines (883k!!!) the index files range from 15k
to 55k. The average is 40k. 88% of the files are <= 48k.
