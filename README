What is it?
-----------

I read about 30 to 40 comics daily from the net. That is along with
the comics in the newspaper. I wrote an emacs lisp program to download
them all for convenient viewing.

However, when I go away on vacation, I wanted something to download
the comics daily and save them. I had problems getting emacs to
startup and run reliably, so I quickly wrote the first get-comics.


get-comics
----------

Get-comics is a multi-threaded app that is driven by an xml file to
download comics. I wrote it multi-threaded because I needed it
fast. This was basically a prototype. It works, but it tends to swamp
my proxy server.


get-comics2
-----------

Get-comics2 is a single threaded version of get-comics. Rather than
spawning a thread per connection, it handles all the connections in a
single thread using the `select' call. I find this version much more
reliable than the multi-threaded version. It also has lower resource
usage.

get-comics-3
------------

Get-comics3 uses libcurl. I am finding that libcurl hangs too
often. But I am hoping a later version will be more robust.


Documentation
-------------

The documentation for get-comics is either in man format
(get-comics.1) or an html version (get-comics.html)

There is a sample xml file that I use (get-comics.xml) and an empty
xml file for testing (test.xml).
