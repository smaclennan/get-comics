GET-COMICS under WINDOWS
------------------------

Get-comics should compile and run natively under Windows 95 and up. It
uses winsocks 2. Compile it from the win32 directory.

Windows now uses JSON_parser.c and does not need any external
libraries, only the standard SDK ones.

Tested May 2011 on Vista.
