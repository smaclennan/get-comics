GET-COMICS under WINDOWS
------------------------

Get-comics should compile and run natively under Windows 95 and up. It
uses winsocks 2. Compile it from the win32 directory.

Windows now uses my-parser.c and does not need any external
libraries, only the standard SDK ones.

With the addition of polarssl, it also can handle https urls. The only
thing it is missing is zlib support.

Tested May 2011 on Vista.
Tested Nov 2013 on Windows 8.
