.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
get-comics is a program to batch download comics from the net. It was
written to automagically download comics every day while I was on
vacation and computerless.
.PP
get-comics uses an xml file to describe how to download the comics.
.PP
get-today is a small shell script that puts all the days comics in a
subdirectory based on the date. It then builds an index.html of the
comics. It is here as a sample only.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-d directory\fR
where to download the comics to. Overrides the xml file. Defaults to
$HOME/comics.
.TP
\fB\-k\fR
keep the downloaded index files. Usually these are deleted. Useful
for debugging.
.TP
\fB\-p proxy[:port]\fR
proxy and optional port (defaults to 3128). Overrides the xml file.
.TP
\fB\-t threads\fR
number of download threads
.TP
\fB\-v\fR
increase verbosity
.TP
\fB\-x xml_failed_file\fR
put the failed xml in a file.
.TP
\fBxml_file\fR
alternate xml file to use. Defaults to get-comics.xml
.SH "HOW IT WORKS"
.PP
get-comics reads the xml file and downloads the comics. It can
download more than one comic at a time. The default
is to limit to 10 concurrent connections, but the \fB\-t threads\fR option
can be used to override this.
.PP
The comics are divided into two types: direct download and
two-stage download. Direct download corresponds to comics with a fixed
or date based URL. All URLs are passed through
.IR strftime ,
with the current time so that all
.IR strftime ,
format characters work.
.PP
Two-stage downloads are for non-fixed URLs. First, the comics page is
downloaded. A regular expression (see
.BR regex (7))
is applied to the page and the result is the comic to download.
.SH "XML FORMAT"
.PP
The xml file is very powerful. The sample \fIget-comics.xml\fR file has a lot of
examples, some fairly complex.
.PP
HTML style comments \fB<!-- -->\fR can be placed almost anywhere
except within tags that expect values.
.PP
The following two lines (or something like them) must be at the top of
the xml file. \fBWarning\fR: I am not an expert on XML. I am pretty
sure I should have something different for the xmlns:comics parameter,
but what I describe here works.
.PP
.B <?xml version="1.0"?>
.br
.B <comics:Configuration xmlns:comics="http://seanm.ca/">
.PP
And the following closing tag is needed at the bottom:
.PP
.B </comics:Configuration>
.SH "Top Level Tags"
.PP
The following tags are general and are overridden by the command line
options:
.TP
.B <directory>
specifies the directory to put the comics in.
.TP
.B <threads>
specifies the maximum number of threads to create at one time.
.TP
.B <proxy>
specifies the proxy and an optional port.
.TP
.B <timeout>
specifies the maximum time to wait for a read in milliseconds
.TP
.B <comic>
this tag starts a comic.
.SH "Comic Tags"
.TP
.B <url>
specifies an URL. Either the comic URL for direct comics, or the index
page for two-stage comics. The URL is processed through \fIstrftime\fR
before being used.
.TP
.B <regexp>
for two-stage comics only, this is the regular expression used to try
to match the comic in the index page.
.TP
.B <regmatch>
if you want to match only a sub-expression of the regular expression,
put the sub-expression number here. get-comics will store up to three sub-expressions.
.TP
.B <days>
some comics are only available on certain days of the week. The days
tag has the following format: \fB<days>smtwtfs</days>\fR. i.e. the
days of the week starting with Sunday. If a certain day should not be
downloaded, replace it's letter with an X. For example, to download
comics on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday only:
\fB<days>XmXwXfX</days>\fR.
.TP
.B <output>
sometimes the file name of the comic will clash with other comics. For
example, two comics may use the date as the file name. To keep the
comics from overwriting each other, a unique output file name can be
specified with this tag.
.TP
.B <href>
sometimes the URL from the regular expression is not good enough to
specify the entire URL. In this case, you can specify a path to
prepend with the \fB<href>\fR tag.
.TP
.B <optional>
get-comics complains about comics that it cannot download. Sometimes,
you expect it to fail often and don't want a warning. The
\fB<optional>\fR tag tells get-comics not to complain if it cannot
download the file. Use this flag with caution!
.IP
.B <referer>
Some pages must see a referer to work. You can specify the referer
here. You can also specify \fBurl\fR and the value from the
\fB<url>\fR tag will be used.
.SH "A NOTE ABOUT PROXIES"
.PP
get-comics supports accessing the comics via a proxy. There are three
ways to specify the proxy:
.PP
1) The \fB\-p\fR command line option.
.br
2) The xml file \fB<proxy>\fR tag.
.br
3) The \fBCOMICS_PROXY\fR environment variable.
.PP
All proxies are specified as an url with an optional port:
\fB<url>:<port>\fR. The default port is the squid proxy default: 3128.
.PP
The three methods above are listed in order of priority. i.e. The
command line option overrides the proxy tag which overrides the
environment variable.
