get-comics: get-comics - batch download comics
get-comics:
get-comics: get-comics is a program to batch download comics from the net. It was
get-comics: written to automagically download comics every day while I was on
get-comics: vacation and computerless.
get-comics:
get-comics: get-comics uses an xml file to describe how to download the comics.
get-comics:
get-comics: get-today is a small shell script that puts all the days comics in a
get-comics: subdirectory based on the date. It then builds an index.html of the
get-comics: comics. It is here as a sample only.
